### Required Materials

Vixen's support for intelligent fixtures (DMX moving heads) is based on giving Vixen detailed knowledge about your hardware.
To perform this data entry you are going to need the User manual for your fixture that lists the functions your fixture supports and what channel(s) are associated with those functions.

---

### Time Commitment

Expect to spend ~20 minutes defining your fixture profile.   

---

### Background

The Intelligent Fixture Wizard has two purposes:

  1. It creates fixture profiles.  The fixture profile contains what functions the fixture supports and what channels are used for those functions.
  2. It creates Intelligent Fixture display elements and adds them to the display.
