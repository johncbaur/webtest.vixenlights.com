### Background

This wizard page configures optional dimming curves for the fixture outputs.
From this wizard one dimming curve can be configured via the **Setup Dimming Curve** button.
A dimming curve can be useful if you want to ensure you drive the fixture at less than maximum intensity.
Typically used on fixtures with a LED light source.

* **Do Not Include a Dimming Curve** - The default option is not not include any dimming curves.

* **Add Dimming Curve For Fixture** - This option adds a single dimming curve for all color channels.

* **Add Dimming Curve for Each Color Channel** - This option configures a separate dimming curve for each color channel.
                                                 With this option all the dimming curves are initially identical.
                                                 The curves can be further adjusted via the Patching Graphical View.
