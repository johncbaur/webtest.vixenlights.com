### Background

Vixen will examine fixture channels and functions and default the color support.
This selection is hardware dependent.
The Color Wheel option requires that the fixture has a Color Wheel function.
Vixen will extract all the colors from the color wheel and create a color property for the fixture element with a discrete color for each color on the color wheel.

* **No Color Support** - This option can be selected if you want to manually control the color through separate display elements.
                         This option is not recommended.

* **Color Mixing** - This option should be selected when the fixture uses multiple color sources or multiple light sources of different colors.
                     Examples are RGB and RGBW.

* **Color Wheel** - This option should be selected when the fixture has a single white light source and is equipped with a color wheel to change colors.
