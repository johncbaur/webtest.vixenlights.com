### Background

This wizard page determines how many fixture display elements to create and if to group them.
This wizard page also determines the naming convention for the fixtures.
The **Display Elements Preview** to the right gives an indication of how the fixtures will be displayed in the Elements tree.
Note Vixen will modify the element names as necessary to avoid duplicates as all display elements must have unique names.

* **Number of Fixtures to Create** - Number of fixture display elements to create.
                                     Select the Plus ![Plus](/images/docs/usage/display-setup/display-elements/intelligent-fixture-wizard/Plus.png) button to have the wizard create additional fixtures.

* **Element Prefix** - Name prefix for the fixture display elements.

* **Create Group** - Determines if the fixtures are nested under a group in the display element tree.
