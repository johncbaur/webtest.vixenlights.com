### Background

The Edit Channels wizard page defines the channels on the fixture.
The channels in this grid are order dependent.  
When complete the channels in this grid should match your fixture's user manual.
The number of channels in this grid should match your fixture's user manual.
Often intelligent fixtures define channels for the convenience of controlling the fixture from a lighting controller with sliders.
If there are channels that are not needed when controlling the fixture from Vixen they can be skipped by placing an Ignore row and a function of **None**.
A channel with a function of **None** will be ignored by Vixen.  Including these ignore rows are important to keep patching to a controller easy and straightforward.
